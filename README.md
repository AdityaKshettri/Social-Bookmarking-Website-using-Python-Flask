# Social-Bookmarking-Website-using-Python-Flask
In this project, I have worked on Python 3 using Flask Virtual Environment to create a Social Bookmarking Website for saving bookmarks on particular sites using SQLAlchemy database.

# How to run this project :

1- Download and open the project in Visual Studio Code.

2- Run the manage.py file to create the server.
> python manage.py runserver

3- Now you can goto localhost:5000 and work on the website.
